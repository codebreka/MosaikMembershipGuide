<b>How to Use this Guide</b>

When you’re looking through our guide, we’d like you to keep one thing in mind. We created this book as a compass, a guide, a north star if you will, to help give you some context and information about how we operate. But keeping an open mind, collaborating, and continuously learning are all values that we take extremely seriously, and this applies to our guide as well!

You’ll notice we haven’t printed our book, and that’s because we’re constantly adding to it, developing it, and changing it accordingly. If you have any thoughts or suggestions, let us know. 

<b>Or better yet…</b>

Make It Better Yourself
Our handbook will also be available as an opensource project on GitHub. We’ve engineered it so that it’s constantly ready for improvement and new development -- to submit a change simply make a pull request and add your contribution!
